Lasku Invoicing System
=======================

Web-based invoicing system for freelancers and small businesses, inspired by FusionInvoice.

The goal of Lasku is to provide a simple, easy to install, easy to use, and powerful invoicing system for small businesses. Although it's inspired by FusionInvoice (it's a great invoicing system, you should check it out!), this project is built from ground up using Kohana and TideSDK frameworks.
