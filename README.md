Installation

The online edition requires a web server to host Lasku. Here we cover 
installation on Apache-based web server. Installation on IIS or other 
web server might need slight adjustments.

1. Download and unpack Lasku zip package.
2. Upload Lasku files to a public directory on your web server.
3. Create an empty MySQL database on the server. Also, prepare a database 
   user to access it.
4. Open the location where you put the files using a web browser, for 
   example `http://your-domain.com/path/to/lasku`.
5. Lasku installer will be displayed. Follow the instructions to begin 
   installation.

Once the installation finishes, you can login to Lasku using the default 
administrator user:
```
Username: admin@your-domain.com
Password: admin
```

Do not forget to change the default password once you are logged in.

For more information on installation, please refer to Lasku Documentation 
at **`/docs`** using your web browser.
